<!-- convex-ai-start -->

This project uses [Convex](https://convex.dev) as its backend.

When working on Convex code, **always read
`convex/_generated/ai/guidelines.md` first** for important guidelines on
how to correctly use Convex APIs and patterns. The file contains rules that
override what you may have learned about Convex from training data.

Convex agent skills for common tasks can be installed by running
`npx convex ai-files install`.

## Resposnses & prose

- A question is a request for an answer, not for changes. If the message
  opens with "how hard would it be", "what are your thoughts", "why does", "should we", "is it possible", "can X do Y", or otherwise asks rather than instructs, answer it do not edit the files.

## Doing the work

- Infer the outcome I want from the request, conversation,
  and project context. Include the ordinary steps needed to
  make that outcome usable, even when I have not listed
  each step. Keep this within the requested scope.

- Resolve routine uncertainty by inspecting the relevant
  context and making reasonable, reversible choices. Ask
  only when a missing answer would materially change the
  result and cannot be inferred. Continue independent
  work while waiting.

- Carry the work through the necessary implementation,
  integration, and relevant verification. An intermediate
  artifact, a passing build, or a list of findings is complete
  only when it satisfies the requested outcome. Keep
  explanations concise without shortening the work.

- In performance work, measure the actual bottleneck
  before changing it. Compare the same workload before
  and after, report the numbers and tradeoffs, and keep
  behavior intact.

- Type-safety is useful take advantage of it.

- Do not delete something that the I did not explicitly request.

- Tests are good. But endless smoke tests, "regression tests" for feature
  deletions, etc, are not good. Tests should be focused, not slop.

- Comments are a great way to clarify functionality and how code is
  used. Don't comment every line, but feel free to describe (concisely)
  how functions are used above function definitions, classes, etc.

- Keep comments up to date! When making changes, it's important to
  keep things in sync

- Never do Live browser testing, or use your browser to check things that i never asked you to do.

## Typescript Preferences

- `any` is the enemy. Inferred types are our friend. Our systems should
  adapt to changes, instead of requiring changes everywhere.

- If your TS code looks like a Python dev wrote it, it is bad TS code.

- Use Mattpocock skills & workflows when writing TS, use the `$ask-matt` skill.

## Work with other agents

- Dont use multiple agent for work that one agent can complete in one pass.

- Do not create subagents or an agent panel for routine work.

- Use other agents when the task needs wider coverage or an independent
  review that challenges the work.

- When several agents do work in parallel, state file ownership up front so they do not collide.

## Visual designs

- For dark mode, use a true black (`#000`) background or a similar dark color.

- Use white for the primary text in dark mode.

- Never use light gray/white text text in dark mode.

- Do not add decorative card frames or pill shapes.

- Keep the text to a minimum.

- Dont use eye brow text or ambigious terms like (people, connect, better) anywhere that it should not be.

- Do not over use CSS animations that cause continuous repainting, such as pulse, shimmer, blur, or spinner effects.
  - These animations cause high GPU use on displays with high refresh rates.

- Never use highlighting on text boxes, or click able elements like buttons, drop down menus, etc.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Specs and issues live as local Markdown files under `.scratch/`. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Local issue status uses the standard agent label names. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

This repo uses one root `CONTEXT.md` and system decisions under `docs/adr/`. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
